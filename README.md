# Guess the Number


# Objective of the Game:
The player must guess a random number chosen by the computer within a specified range.

# Rules of the Game:
Range Selection: The computer randomly selects a number within a given range (e.g., from 1 to 100).

# Attempts: The player enters a number, trying to guess the chosen number.

# Hints: After each attempt, the computer indicates whether the chosen number is higher or lower than the entered number.
If the entered number is lower than the chosen number, the message "The chosen number is higher" is displayed.
If the entered number is higher than the chosen number, the message "The chosen number is lower" is displayed.

# Victory: The game continues until the player guesses the chosen number. When the player guesses the number, a victory message is displayed along with the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

# Exiting the Game: The player can end the game at any time by entering a special command (e.g., 'exit').

# Error Handling: If the player enters an incorrect value (e.g., letters instead of numbers), an error message is displayed, and the prompt is repeated.

# Example:
