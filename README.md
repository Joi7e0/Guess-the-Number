## Objective of the Game:
The player must guess a random number chosen by the computer within a specified range.

## Rules of the Game:

### Range Selection
The computer randomly selects a number within a given range (e.g., from 1 to 100).

### Attempts
The player enters a number, trying to guess the chosen number.

### Hints
After each attempt, the computer indicates whether the chosen number is higher or lower than the entered number.
- If the entered number is lower than the chosen number, the message "The chosen number is higher" is displayed.
- If the entered number is higher than the chosen number, the message "The chosen number is lower" is displayed.

### Victory
The game continues until the player guesses the chosen number. When the player guesses the number, a victory message is displayed along with the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

### Exiting the Game
The player can end the game at any time by entering a special command (e.g., 'exit').

### Error Handling
If the player enters an incorrect value (e.g., letters instead of numbers), an error message is displayed, and the prompt is repeated.
